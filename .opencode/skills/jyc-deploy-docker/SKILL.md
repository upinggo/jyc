description: Build and deploy jyc in Docker container using s6 process supervisor. Use when instructed to build, deploy, or build-and-deploy jyc.

## Critical Safety: Build/Deploy Operations
CRITICAL: AI MUST use TWO-PHASE CONFIRMATION for ALL build/deploy operations:

Phase 1 - Present Plan:
- List ALL commands that will be executed
- Explain what each command does
- State potential risks (e.g., "build will take 2-3 min", "deploy will restart the session")

Phase 2 - Wait for Approval:
- Ask the user to type "yes" or "proceed" to continue
- If the user responds with anything else, ABORT the operation
- Only execute commands after receiving explicit "yes" or "proceed"

CRITICAL: Never execute build/deploy commands without explicit user approval.

## Build Environment
- The source is bind-mounted from the host into the container
- CARGO_TARGET_DIR is set to /tmp/jyc-target to avoid cross-platform conflicts with the host's target/ directory
- Do NOT build into ./target/ directly — always use the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable (already set)
- Rust is pre-installed in the dev image. If using the production image, install it on-demand:
  `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y && source "$HOME/.cargo/env"`

## Build (when instructed)
MUST follow TWO-PHASE CONFIRMATION above before executing.
MUST execute EXACTLY these commands in order:

1. Ensure Rust is installed (see above)
2. cd jyc && cargo test
3. cargo build --release
4. $CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/jyc --version
5. Report: version, binary size, test results

CRITICAL: Do NOT improvise or use alternative build commands.

## Deploy (when instructed)
MUST follow TWO-PHASE CONFIRMATION above before executing.

WARNING: Deploy causes JYC to restart. Your session will be interrupted.
WARNING: A startup notification email will confirm the new version is running.

MUST execute EXACTLY these steps in order:

Step 1: Verify $CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/jyc exists
Step 2: Send a reply FIRST using the reply_message tool — confirm the deployment is starting and report the build results
Step 3: AFTER the reply is sent, execute these deploy commands EXACTLY:
   ```
   cp $CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/jyc /usr/local/bin/jyc && s6-svc -r /run/service/jyc
   ```
Step 4: STOP immediately after running the deploy commands. Do NOT run any more commands.

CRITICAL Warnings:
- Do NOT send a reply AFTER the deploy commands — the process will be dead and the reply will fail
- Do NOT run the deploy commands multiple times — one restart is sufficient
- Do NOT improvise or use alternative commands (e.g., do NOT use `s6-svc -t /run/service/jyc` or any other variant)

## Build and Deploy (when instructed)
MUST follow TWO-PHASE CONFIRMATION above before executing.
MUST execute EXACTLY these steps in order:

1. Run the Build steps above (test + compile)
2. Run the Deploy steps above (reply first, then cp + restart, then STOP)
