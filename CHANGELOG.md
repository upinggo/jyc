# Changelog

All notable changes to JYC will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-03-30

### Added

**systemd service support for process supervision and self-bootstrapping**
- systemd user service at `~/.config/systemd/user/jyc.service` for process supervision
- `run-jyc.sh` wrapper script that sources `~/.zshrc.local` for environment variables
- `jyc-ctl.sh` control script for service management (status, logs, restart, stop, start)
- `SYSTEMD.md` documentation with setup, usage, and troubleshooting guide
- `system.md.example` updated with systemd bootstrap instructions
- Automatic restarts on crash (`Restart=always` with 5-second delay)
- Service configuration tracked in repository (no s6-overlay)
- Environment variables from `.zshrc.local` available to jyc (API keys, etc.)

**Combined provider/model name in reply context and log spans**
- Model field in reply-context.json now uses `<provider-id>/<model-id>` format (instead of just model_id)
- Log span `m` field also uses combined format (e.g., `ark/deepseek-v3.2:build`)
- Applied to both email reply footers and structured logging
- Example: `ark/deepseek-v3.2` instead of `deepseek-v3.2`

### Removed

**s6-overlay approach** (replaced by systemd)
- `s6-rc.d/` directory and service configuration files
- `start-jyc.sh` (s6 initialization script)
- `NATIVE_S6.md` (s6-specific documentation)

### Changed

- **DESIGN.md**: Added reference to `SYSTEMD.md` in References section
- **Cargo.toml**: Bumped version from 0.0.8 to 0.0.9

## [0.0.8] - 2026-03-28

### Changed

**Disk-based reply context (replaces REPLY_TOKEN)**
- Reply context saved to `.jyc/reply-context.json` per-thread before AI prompt
- MCP reply tool reads context from disk (cwd) instead of decoding a base64 token
- AI never sees or touches the context — zero corruption risk
- `token` parameter removed from `reply_message` tool schema — only `message` and `attachments`
- REPLY_TOKEN line removed from AI prompt entirely
- Token-related system prompt instructions removed (no more "pass as-is" warnings)
- Context includes `model` and `mode` fields for future footer use
- Context file deleted by reply tool after successful send (cleanup)

### Removed
- `serialize_context()` and `deserialize_context()` functions (base64 token approach)
- `REPLY_TOKEN=` from prompt text
- Token integrity checks (backtick detection, nonce validation) — no longer needed
- `build_footer()` function and model/mode from `build_full_reply_text()`
- `model` and `mode` fields from `AgentResult` (agent is channel-agnostic)
- `model` and `mode` parameters from `EmailOutboundAdapter::send_reply()`

## [0.0.7] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

**Session preservation — keep session whenever possible**
- Model passed per-prompt (`PromptRequest.model`) — `/model` switch no longer deletes session
- Mode passed per-prompt (`PromptRequest.agent`) — `/plan` and `/build` switches no longer delete session
- `opencode.json` config changes no longer delete session — server picks up changes per-directory
- Session survives: model switches, mode switches, config changes, container restarts
- Session only deleted for error recovery: ContextOverflow and stale session detection

**Prompt echo stripping fix**
- Changed from join-then-strip to per-part filtering
- Each text part individually checked for prompt echo markers (`## Incoming Message`, `REPLY_TOKEN=`)
- Fixes: AI fallback text was lost when prompt echo and actual response were in separate SSE parts

**Logging improvements (from pre-release fixes)**
- Duplicate `m` field in `ai` span fixed — recorded once when model discovered
- Duplicate tool logs deduplicated with HashSet per step
- Tool input shown in logs (`Tool running tool=bash input="cargo build"`)
- Duplicate "Reply sent by MCP tool" log removed from thread_manager
- Session reuse: `get_session` now sends `x-opencode-directory` header
- Debug logging for `config_changed` and `get_session` response status

### Fixed
- Session reuse across container restarts: `get_session()` was missing `x-opencode-directory` header → server couldn't find session → always created new
- Fallback reply empty when AI produces prompt echo + actual response in separate text parts
- `/model` and mode commands unnecessarily deleted session (model/mode are per-prompt, not per-session)
- Cleaned up agent task artifacts: removed model/mode from ReplyContext, AgentResult, build_full_reply_text, EmailOutboundAdapter (these are per-prompt concerns, not per-token/per-adapter)

### Added

**Docker: two image variants**
- `jyc:dev` (target `dev`, ~2GB) — Rust pre-installed for self-bootstrapping, no timeout during cargo install
- `jyc:latest` (target `production`, ~740MB) — no Rust, production use
- Both share the same `base` stage (cached) — building one caches the base for the other
- `docker-compose.yml` defaults to `dev` target, configurable via `JYC_BUILD_TARGET` env var

## [0.0.6] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

**Token format: `REPLY_TOKEN=`**
- `<reply_context>TOKEN</reply_context>` → `REPLY_TOKEN=TOKEN` — no XML tags, avoids triggering AI's "parse structured data" instinct
- Tool parameter description updated to reference `REPLY_TOKEN=` line
- Prompt echo stripping marker updated

**Conversation history removed from AI prompt**
- OpenCode session memory handles multi-turn conversation context
- `build_conversation_history()` function removed (dead code)
- `include_history` parameter removed from `build_prompt()`
- System prompt simplified — no "Conversation history" section reference
- `include_thread_history` config field deprecated (kept for backward compat but ignored)

**DESIGN.md comprehensive update**
- Removed all jiny-m references (moved to IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- Removed "Differences from jiny-m" comparison table
- PromptBuilder: updated for no history, REPLY_TOKEN format
- ReplyContext → Reply Token: minimal 5-field description
- Context Management Strategy: rewritten for session-based (not prompt-based)
- Data Flow Summary, sequence diagram, block diagrams: all updated
- MCP Tool section: reads from disk, not token
- Stripping Strategy table: removed AI Prompt Context row
- Config example: removed `include_thread_history`

**Cargo.toml description**
- Removed "Rust rewrite of jiny-m" — JYC is its own project

## [0.0.5] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

**Minimal reply context token (corruption-proof)**
- Token slimmed from 12 fields to 5: `channel`, `threadName`, `incomingMessageDir`, `uid`, `_nonce`
- All message metadata (sender, recipient, topic, threading headers) now read from stored `received.md` frontmatter — NOT from the AI-passed token
- Prevents AI model corruption (e.g., `petalmail.com` → `petailmail.com` causing bounced emails)
- Token is now ~120 bytes base64 instead of ~400 bytes — shorter = less corruption risk
- Switched to standard base64 (with padding) matching jiny-m's format

**Token serialization moved to `mcp/context.rs`**
- `serialize_context()` and `deserialize_context()` now live together in `src/mcp/context.rs`
- Removed from `prompt_builder.rs` — the prompt builder imports from `mcp::context`
- All token logic (struct, serialize, deserialize, validate) in one place

**Enriched received.md frontmatter**
- Added `sender`, `sender_address`, `external_id`, `reply_to_id`, `thread_refs`, `matched_pattern` to YAML frontmatter
- Reply tool reads all metadata from disk (authoritative source) instead of trusting token
- `parse_stored_message()` extracts all new frontmatter fields

**Docker: 3-stage build + image size optimization**
- Restructured to base (tools, cached) → builder (Rust compile) → final (base + binary)
- Removed Rust toolchain from runtime image (~1.23GB saved, image ~740MB)
- AI installs Rust on-demand for self-bootstrapping (~30s)
- `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/jyc-target` avoids cross-platform conflict with host macOS builds
- Cargo registry + git cached in named Docker volumes
- OpenCode data volume for session persistence across container restarts
- Builder uses `rust:bookworm` matching runtime's glibc version

**Logging**
- `system.md loaded` / `No system.md found` log when building system prompt

## [0.0.4] - 2026-03-27

### Added

**Phase 6: Resilience + Polish**
- Alert service (`src/core/alert_service.rs`): background task buffers ERROR events, flushes as digest emails at configured intervals. Health check reports with per-thread stats at configured intervals. Self-protection via `eprintln` for send failures (no feedback loop).
- `AppLogger` — unified logging + alerting handle. Components call `app_logger.info()`, `.error()`, `.message_received()`, `.reply_by_tool()` etc. Each call delegates to `tracing` for console output AND sends structured events to the alert service for stats tracking + error buffering. Replaces separate `tracing` + `AlertHandle` dependencies.
- Progress tracker (`src/core/progress_tracker.rs`): sends periodic "still working" emails during long AI operations. Configurable initial delay (default 3 min), interval (default 3 min), max messages (default 5). Polling every 5s with `tokio::time::interval`.
- Startup notification email: sent on monitor start with version, timestamp, channel count, agent mode
- Graceful shutdown: alert service final flush before exit, OpenCode server stopped, all worker tasks awaited

### Changed
- `/model` with no args now shows current model (from override or config default) instead of "not yet implemented"
- `AlertHandle` renamed to `AppLogger` to reflect its dual role as logger + alerter
- Structured logging: `channel=` and `thread=` fields added consistently to all key log lines across IMAP monitor, message router, thread manager, and OpenCode service. Enables easy filtering by channel or thread in production logs.

### Fixed
- Error handling audit: all production `unwrap()` calls verified safe (static regex, guarded strip_prefix)

## [0.0.3] - 2026-03-27

### Added

**Phase 5: MCP Reply Tool + Commands**
- MCP reply tool (`src/mcp/reply_tool.rs`): `rmcp` stdio server with `reply_message` tool. Decodes context token → loads config → reads received.md → builds full reply with quoted history → sends via SMTP with file attachments → stores reply.md → writes signal file
- `jyc mcp-reply-tool` hidden subcommand wired to rmcp server
- Reply context deserialization (`src/mcp/context.rs`): base64 → JSON → validation with tamper detection
- `/model <id>`, `/model reset` command handler — writes `.jyc/model-override`, forces new session
- `/plan`, `/build` command handlers — writes/removes `.jyc/mode-override`
- Commands wired into thread_manager: parse → execute → reply results → strip → check body → dispatch to agent

**Architecture: AgentService trait**
- `AgentService` trait (`src/services/agent.rs`): `process(message, thread_name, thread_path, message_dir) → AgentResult`
- `StaticAgentService` (`src/services/static_agent.rs`): fixed text reply with quoted history
- `OpenCodeService` implements `AgentService`: owns full reply lifecycle (AI interaction + fallback send + storage)
- ThreadManager dispatches via `Arc<dyn AgentService>` — zero mode-specific code
- Adding new agent modes requires only: implement trait + match arm in `cli/monitor.rs`

**File attachment support**
- SMTP client: `MultiPart::mixed` with `Attachment` parts, MIME type detection by extension
- Email outbound adapter: reads files from disk, builds `EmailAttachment` structs
- MCP reply tool: validates attachment paths, builds `OutboundAttachment`, passes to outbound

**Email body extraction fix**
- Prefers HTML→Markdown conversion (via `htmd`) over raw plain text — mobile email clients generate poor plain text with no line breaks
- HTML cleaning before conversion: strips `<style>`, `<script>`, `<head>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, CSS `@import`/`@media` rules, HTML comments

### Changed
- `message.channel` now contains config channel **name** (e.g., "jiny283"), not type ("email") — fixes MCP reply tool config lookup
- Session reuse restored: `get_or_create_session()` reuses existing session if valid on server, only creates new on config change or server restart — AI maintains conversation memory across messages
- Session state file renamed: `session.json` → `opencode-session.json` — avoids future naming conflicts with other service sessions
- Removed unused `emailCount` field from `SessionState`
- MCP server name: `"rmcp"` → `"jiny_reply"` with `#[tool_handler]` macro — fixes tool discovery (was `toolCount=0`)
- Noisy IMAP polling logs moved from DEBUG to TRACE level
- Empty AI text parts no longer logged at DEBUG level
- Session error logging: fallback to raw property extraction when struct deserialization fails
- SSE model_id/provider_id: no longer overwritten with None by subsequent events

### Fixed
- MCP tool not discovered by OpenCode: missing `#[tool_handler]` attribute on `ServerHandler` impl
- Channel lookup in reply tool: `config.channels.get("email")` → `config.channels.get("jiny283")`
- `strip_quoted_history`: added `发件时间` to Chinese reply header detection

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-27

### Added

**Phase 4: AI Integration**
- OpenCode server manager: auto-start `opencode serve`, free port discovery, stdout-based readiness detection, health check, graceful shutdown with `kill_on_drop`
- OpenCode HTTP client: `create_session`, `get_session`, `prompt_async`, `prompt_blocking` with `x-opencode-directory` header and `?directory=` query param
- SSE streaming: subscribe to `/event?directory=`, parse events from JSON `{"type": "...", "properties": {...}}` format, activity-based timeout (30min default, 60min when tool running), progress logging with model info
- SSE event handling: `server.connected`, `server.heartbeat`, `message.updated` (model/provider capture), `message.part.updated` (tool state tracking), `session.status`, `session.idle`, `session.error`
- Session management: per-thread `.jyc/session.json`, fresh session per prompt (avoids stale sessions across server restarts), `opencode.json` generation with staleness check
- Prompt builder: system prompt (config + directory boundaries + reply instructions + system.md), user prompt (conversation history + incoming body + base64 reply_context token)
- OpenCodeService (`src/services/opencode/service.rs`): encapsulates all AI logic — server lifecycle, sessions, prompts, SSE, error recovery. Returns `GenerateReplyResult` to ThreadManager.
- ContextOverflow recovery: delete session, create new, retry with blocking prompt
- Stale session detection: tool reported success in SSE but signal file missing → delete + retry
- Fallback reply with quoted history: `build_full_reply_text()` shared function for both fallback and future MCP reply tool
- Prompt echo stripping: removes `## Incoming Message`, `<reply_context>`, `## Conversation history` markers from AI output when tool fails

**Architecture: ThreadManager ↔ OpenCodeService separation**
- ThreadManager: queue management, concurrency control, agent mode dispatch, fallback send
- OpenCodeService: AI-specific logic isolated from infrastructure. Does NOT send emails.

### Changed
- IMAP ID command: now logs `server_name`, `server_vendor`, `trans_id` as structured fields (no raw map dump)
- IMAP monitor: backoff on SELECT failure (was tight retry loop)
- DESIGN.md: added OpenCode Server HTTP API reference (https://opencode.ai/docs/server/), responsibility separation docs, updated Worker Processing Flow diagram, OpenCode server shutdown lifecycle table

### Fixed
- IMAP `SELECT INBOX` rejected by 163.com with "Unsafe Login" — added RFC 2971 ID command after login
- OpenCode server command: `opencode server` → `opencode serve` with `--hostname=` / `--port=` syntax
- OpenCode server readiness: detect by parsing stdout for `"opencode server listening on http://..."` instead of HTTP polling
- SSE event parsing: event type is in JSON `data.type` field, not SSE `event:` field
- SSE subscription: added `?directory=` query param to scope events to thread project context
- Explicit `opencode_server.stop()` on graceful shutdown

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- CLI skeleton with `clap` — subcommands: `monitor`, `config init`, `config validate`, `patterns list`, `state`, and hidden `mcp-reply-tool`
- TOML configuration with `${ENV_VAR}` substitution for secrets
- Configuration validation with structured error reporting
- Core types: `InboundMessage`, `InboundAdapter`/`OutboundAdapter` traits, channel pattern matching types
- `ChannelRegistry` for adapter lookup by channel name
- Unified `CommandRegistry::process_commands()` — single-pass parse, execute, and strip commands from message body (improved over jiny-m's split design)
- `CommandHandler` trait for extensible email commands (`/model`, `/plan`, `/build`)
- `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` for structured async-aware logging with `--debug` and `--verbose` CLI flags
- Error types via `thiserror`, application errors via `anyhow`
- Utility functions: `parse_file_size`, `validate_regex`, `extract_domain`, `sanitize_for_filesystem`
- Default constants for timeouts, context limits, and configuration defaults

**Phase 2: Email I/O Layer**
- IMAP client wrapper (`async-imap` + `async-native-tls`) with TLS, login, SELECT, FETCH by UID/range, IDLE support, and disconnect
- IMAP ID command (RFC 2971) sent after login — required by 163.com (NetEase) to avoid "Unsafe Login" rejection
- Email parser: `strip_reply_prefix` (Re:/Fwd:/回复:/转发:), `derive_thread_name`, `strip_quoted_history`, `clean_email_body`, `truncate_text`, `parse_stored_message`, `parse_stored_reply`, `format_quoted_reply`
- Email inbound adapter: `mail-parser` raw bytes → `InboundMessage` with boundary cleaning; pattern matching (sender exact/domain/regex + subject prefix/regex, AND logic, first match wins)
- SMTP client (`lettre`) with TLS, threading headers (`In-Reply-To`, `References`), markdown→HTML via `comrak` (GFM), auto-reconnect on connection errors
- HTML→Markdown conversion via `htmd`
- Email outbound adapter: `send_reply`, `send_alert`, `send_progress_update` — thread-safe via `Arc<Mutex<SmtpClient>>`
- Per-channel state manager: `.imap/.state.json` + `.processed-uids.txt` for IMAP sequence tracking and UID deduplication

**Phase 3: Core Processing Pipeline**
- Message storage: `received.md` with YAML frontmatter, `reply.md`, attachment saving with extension allowlist, size limits, collision resolution
- Thread manager: per-thread `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels with `Semaphore`-bounded concurrency (configurable `max_concurrent_threads`)
- Message router: delegates pattern matching to channel adapter, derives thread name, dispatches to thread manager
- IMAP monitor: connect → SELECT → check_for_new → IDLE/poll → loop; exponential backoff on errors; recovery on message deletion; first-run only processes latest message
- Full `jyc monitor` wiring: load config → validate → Ctrl+C handler → per-channel SMTP connect → ThreadManager → Router → StateManager → spawn ImapMonitor tasks → await shutdown
- Placeholder reply in OpenCode mode (sends confirmation email with message metadata until Phase 4 AI integration)
